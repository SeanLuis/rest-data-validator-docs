# Roadmap

The `rest-data-validator` project aims to continually evolve with the needs of developers and the dynamics of RESTful API design. Below is a tentative roadmap of features and improvements we're exploring:

## Upcoming Features

- **~~Nested Validation Support~~**: Implement validation for complex, nested data structures to accommodate intricate API schemas.

- **~~Asynchronous Validators~~**: Introduce validators capable of handling asynchronous operations, useful for database lookups or external API validations.

- **Internationalization**: Offer localized error messages to better serve a global user base.

- **Sanitization Enhancements**: Expand sanitization utilities for preprocessing data, ensuring robust input handling before validation.

- **Framework Middleware**: Develop middleware for seamless integration with popular server frameworks like Express and NestJS.

- **Runtime Type System Integration**: Explore compatibility with runtime type validation libraries to enhance JavaScript validation capabilities.

- **~~CLI Tooling~~**: Build CLI tools for generating validator schemas from TypeScript type definitions, aiding in rapid development cycles.

- **Plugin Architecture**: Create an extensible plugin system allowing custom validators and sanitizers, fostering community-driven enhancements.

- **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize the core validation logic to efficiently handle large datasets and reduce overhead in high-throughput environments.

- **GUI for Schema Building**: Provide a graphical interface for constructing and exporting validation schemas, streamlining the setup process for `rest-data-validator`.

We welcome community input and contributions to help shape the future of `rest-data-validator`. If you have ideas or features youâ€™d like to see, please open an issue to start the conversation.

Note: The roadmap is subject to change and reflects current planning and priorities.
